# TOPCAFDQM

Online monitoring software package for TOPCAF.

## Usage

Copy this program under modules/ directory in topcaf package. After compiling with scons, run the test.sh in examles/ directory to test with one run from module 17. This will plot the waveforms for each channel in an event.

## TODO

1. drawWaveforms() crashes sometimes.
2. Make the code work with other modules.
3. Add more online plots.
